Windows Form Take 2 was based on one of the answers of this stack overflow article; but it didn't work, buecause I'm not running windows...

As one comment says, "Windows Forms is exclusive to the [Desktop] Windows platform. You can certainly not use VSCode for that, not even in Windows, as VSCode doesn't include form designer tools like the regular Visual Studio IDE. So even in case you could compile, there are still lacking all the facilities needed for designing."

The comment suggests MonoDevelop for Linux, but that has been discontinued after being bought by Microsoft (and it doesn't look like it would be easy to get up and running given the work I've already put in). I'll check Electron.NET next, but chances are there's no easy way to use WindowsForms on Linux.

Here is the link for Electron - but I'm not sure it's what I'm looking for.
