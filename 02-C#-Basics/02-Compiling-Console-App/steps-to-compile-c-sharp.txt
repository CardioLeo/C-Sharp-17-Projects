open Administrator Command Prompt

It should open to the directory:
C:\Windows\system32

If it doesn't, that probably means you didn't open as an admin.
For some reason you can't right click on it from the taskbar to open
as admin. But you can open as admin by right clicking on it in the
start menu.

Next:

cd ..

cd Microsoft.NET

cd Framework

// for example, you should get the following output for running "pwd"
// /c/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework

dir // lists all directories in this directory (ok...)
// ls doesn't work, :(

// csc is "c-sharp-compiler"

cd v4.0.30319 // or whatever is latest version of the compiler
// mine currently is same compiler

csc /help // tells you the commands you can use with the compiler

run command:

csc /t:exe /out:c:\HelloWorld\HelloWorld.exe c:\HelloWorld\HelloWorld.cs

// but!! his path is different from mine, so the third and final argument must be different

// 1. /t:exe creates executable
// 2. /out creates output file... (that isn't the executable?)
// next, specify the file you're going to compile

// so, my command looked more like this:

csc /t:exe /out:c:\Users\William\.......\01-First-Console-App\HelloWorld.exe c:\Users\William\........\01-First-Console-App\HelloWorld.cs

if I go to the directory listed in argument two of this command, I can run the HelloWorld application
