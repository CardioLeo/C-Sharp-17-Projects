The above link is from Visual Studio Magazine and helps explain how to get and use web forms
in VS 2022, which I have. This is important because the course uses an earlier form of
Visual Studio which has easier access to Web Forms.

PLEASE NOTE.

You do not have to re-install the whole visual studio application.

But you do need to open the intsaller.

Read the instructions in the link carefully, as within the installer you will go to "modify" the install,
then you will go to "Individual components," and then find ".NET Framework project and item templates." This is evidently what I was missing, even though I installed every workload related to web dev and C#.

This will be a huge relief, though, as it looks like it'll allow me to figure out why I couldn't find
the simple option for "web forms" that the course clearly had when I clearly didn't.
