I found a problem.

The link for the actual currency converter is (or was):

https://www.google.co.uk/finance/converter

but it appears that since this course has come out, Google has discontinued that product.

This is a problem specifically because the bulk of this project is basically importing Google's currency converter into our microsoft form.

I... have a feeling this could be a lot more complicated.

I might just have to write my own logic and code to make this work - but I might also put it off until I finish the course.

We'll see if there are any easier work-arounds. For instance at this live Google link:

https://www.google.com/finance/markets/currencies?hl=en

[Update: no, that second link won't really work and I don't see any easy work-arounds; I'll have to engineer my own solution after finishing the rest of the course.]
