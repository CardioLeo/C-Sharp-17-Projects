for this video we wrote SQL code and executed it within Microsoft's SQL Server Manger
I have included this here in a txt file because I haven't decided yet whether I want
to add the SQL Server folders to the repo for this project; so I wanted some notes to
reflect what we did so far regarding SQL;

we generated the following table:

// loginID	username	password
// 1		joebloggs	password123
// 2		janedoe		password1234
// 3		blargedyblow	passwordless

this was done with code like the following:

// INSERT INTO dbo.logins (loginID,username,password)
// VALUES(3,'blargedyblow','passwordless');

and verified with this:

// SELECT * FROM dbo.logins;
