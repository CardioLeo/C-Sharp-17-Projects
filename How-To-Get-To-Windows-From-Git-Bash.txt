two options:

1. run this command: "cd ~"
but then you can't run basic commands like "touch"
as I just discovered

2. open git bash app as administrator
then you have permission to make documents like the present one

[Something else I've learned is that you can change the default setting in properties so that it usually opens git bash as administrator, so now I can actually use it while pinned to my desktop taskbar without needing to open it in a more tedious way every single time. They say laziness is a virtue in coding.]
