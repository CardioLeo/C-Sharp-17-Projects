I now only have eight projects left.

The last four projects have hit snags of various kinds, the paint one through the calculator (off the top of my head).

The Paint project has trouble with saving the art.

The Web browser one has trouble in that it throws various errors about scripts. I don't completely understand.

The Calculator has so many problems and needs to be completely reworked.

However, I wanted to finish the course before moving on, so I figured I would make this document real quick to help myself feel a bit more like I wasn't simply abandoning the problems, and maybe making it easier to see these problems without even opening the project folders.
