In the last lecture of the Paint Drawing project, the instructor had a clear error (error of syntax and by virtue of syntax, logic also). I don't know yet what he really intended with that - and his IDE didn't give him red squigly lines for it. I suspect it was an error intentionally introduced to make students look into it more. But I haven't had time to do that yet.
